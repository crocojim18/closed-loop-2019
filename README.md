# Computational Linguistics For People Who Specifically Avoid Computational Linguistics

I gave a presentation at Closed Loop 2019, a conference internal to the Pittsburgh office of M\*Modal Ltd. The presentation is about computational lingustics, its foundations, theory, and applications.

Included are the [PowerPoint](Taylor_ClosedLoop.pptx) and [bibliography](sources.md) for the presentation.
